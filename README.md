A new method of accessing blocked sites on school Chromebooks

# How it works?

This exploit uses a very specific kiosk app found on some* school Chromebooks. This uses the Microsoft Online Password Reset lock screen kiosk app (found in 'Apps' on the lock screen) as a web browser, allowing you to bypass any content filtering on the network.

1. If logged in, click the red 'Sign out' button in the taskbar
2. Click 'Apps' on the lock screen
3. Check if there is a button with the words 'Microsoft Online Password Reset' or anything to do with Microsoft and resetting.
4. If you have the Microsoft option, you are all set, if not, you're out of luck.
