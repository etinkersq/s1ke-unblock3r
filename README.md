# s1ke-unblock3r
A new method of accessing blocked sites on school Chromebooks

# How it works?

This exploit uses a very specific kiosk app found on some* school Chromebooks. This uses the Microsoft Online Password Reset lock screen kiosk app (found in 'Apps' on the lock screen) as a web browser, allowing you to bypass any content filtering on the network. And in case you are wondering, doing this does not actually reset anything and you will not get caught, relax!


# Prerequisites

1. If logged in, click the red 'Sign out' button in the taskbar
2. Click 'Apps' on the lock screen
3. *=Check if there is a button with the words 'Microsoft Online Password Reset' or anything to do with Microsoft and resetting.
4. If you have the Microsoft option, you are all set, if not, you're out of luck.

# How to do it?

Instructions:

1. Make sure you are signed out
2. Click Apps at the bottom
3. Click Microsoft Online Password Reset
4. Enter google@d11.org as the email and complete captcha (its case sensitive)
5. Wait, then when the error appears, click the gray “Show additional details” button
6. Click the blue “Learn more” link
7. Scroll all the way down on the website that loads (the Microsoft support website) and look for the link that says “sitemap” (it's all the way down), click it.
8. Scroll down to the “Developer & IT” section and click “GitHub Copilot”
9. Scroll all the way down and click the YouTube icon
10. Once YouTube loads, go to the sidebar and scroll down all the way, and click “Privacy”
11. Scroll all the way down on the Google privacy policy website and click the gray “Google” link.
12. Have fun!

# Limitations

1. You can only open sites in the same tab, if it wants to open in a new tab or window, it is not possible as kisok apps block this behavior
2. You cannot exit fullscreen
3. You will have to go back to Google using the back buttion (to the right of 'esc' on your keyboard) everytime you want to open a new website
4. May not work all the time as the Microsoft password reset site doesn't allow you to use the same email over 5 times within an hour, if you get a red error, wait an hour then try again

# Features

-Access any site

-Does not store history

-Keeps cookies so once you sign in, you don't have to worry anymore

-If you need to get out quickly, hold the power button and click sign out (good panic mode in case a teacher comes up behind you :|)
